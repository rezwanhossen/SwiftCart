## 1.What is the difference between null and undefined?
-> Undefined is a variable that has not been assigned a value. In other words, the variable has been declared but has not been given a value. That is why when we display it in the console, the output will be undefined.
```
let name;
console.log(name);
```
-> Null is a value that the developer intentionally uses to leave a variable empty or without a value. That is, there is no associated value or we are intentionally leaving it empty.
```
let age = null;
console.log(age);
```
